        <h1>Rules</h1>
        <p class="rules">
            All players start with 13 cards, left of dealer starts. Ace high, 2 is higher, 3 is low. Your goal is to get rid of all your cards.
            The first player places a card, and the next player has to either pass, or place a card of higher value on top and so on until no one can place. 
            The last person who can play a card wins and starts the  next round. Winner of the game is "King" and the loser, Scum, has to trade their four most valuable cards
            with the King. </p>
